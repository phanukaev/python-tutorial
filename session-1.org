* Introduction

Due to time constraints, I believe it to be more instructive to take
a "learning by osmosis" approach to programming, and work a practical
example during the seminar.
The first session will introduce the most basic concepts in python as well as
the ~csv~ package, which is used to deal with csv files.

* Getting Help

Since by definition this style of teaching will omit many of the fundamentals,
it will be up to you to learn them yourself.
Hopefully by the end of this session you will have seen enough to be able
to read the [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html][Python Tutorial]] on your own.
The first 6 chapters should suffice for an introduction.
The [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html][CSV package reference]] is quite short and can be read in 20-30 minutes.
For general help there is also the
[[https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html][library reference]] (may be hard to read) or the slightly easier but less
comprehensive [[https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_reference.asp][reference on w3schools]].



* The Problem Statement

Today, we are playing pokemon. Specifically we are playing a modified version
of pokemon called [[https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pokemon-too-many-types-as-seen-in-alpharads-video.501317/][Too Many Types]].
Each pokemon has up to three types and each move has one type.
When a pokemon attacks another with a move, the move's type is compared
against all the defending pokemon's types.
In each case the move can be
neutral (deals normal damage),
super effective (deals double damage),
not very effective (deals half damage),
or have no effect at all.
The information we need is available in a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxYmHs_ZsgzLUrL8WfEGN-JHdToubXHvi942ViDIG8k/][spreadsheet]] online.
As you can see, it is too large to memorize in practive, so we will
be writing a program to calculate damage for us.
I have exported the relevant parts to csv files and cleaned them up slightly.
You can download [[file:resources/pokedex.csv][pokedex.csv]] and [[file:resources/typechart.csv][typechart.csv]] if you wish to follow along.

To determine how effective an attack is, compare the attacking move's type
against all the defender's types, and multiply the modifiers.
For example: Suppose the attacker uses a /fighting/ type move against a Pokemon
with types /normal/, /flying/ and /rock/.
The table shows that fighting type moves deal double damage against normal
type, half damage against flying type, and double damage against rock type.
So the result in this case is ~2 * 0.5 * 2 = 2~.

* The Code
We will now write some code line by line and explain what is going on in the process.
I encourage you to type the code yourself.
Even if you just look at the code below, copying it by typing it yourself
is much more beneficial than using your computer's copy function.
It is also worth noting that coding is exact. Pay special attention to the
following:
Punctuation such as colons (~:~), commas (~,~), periods (~.~), brackets (~[]()~) etc.
and upper case vs lower case letters.

First, since our data is given as two ~csv~ files, we will load the ~csv~ package.
#+begin_src python
  import csv
#+end_src
Next, we will load the data from the csv files into the program.
If you are following along, right click on the project files in Pycharm,
select /open in/ and then /explorer/.[fn::This is for windows users,
on MacOS select /open in/ and it should be the first
option, thought I don't know what it is called.
]

For this we will use a data structure called the /dictionary/.
** Dictionaries
A dictionary[fn::
Learn more about [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries][dictionaries]]
] stores a collection of /keys/ and corresponding /values/.
Each key can occur in a dictionary /only once/,
but values corresponding to different keys may be the same.
The main usage for a dictionary is as follows:
If you have a key, you can ask the dictionary for the corresponding value.
We will explain dictionaries in more detail as we use them.

First, we want to get the information on Pokemon and their types out of
[[file:resources/pokedex.csv][pokedex.csv]].
We will use a dictionary for this.
The keys will be the names of the Pokemon,
and the corresponding value is going to be the list of its types.
The code for this looks as follows and we will step through it line by line
below.
#+begin_src python
  pokedex = {}
  with open('pokedex.csv', 'r') as dex:
      dex_reader = csv.DictReader(dex)
      for row in dex_reader:
          pokemon_name = row['Pokemon'].lower()
          types = [row['Type I'], row['Type II'], row['Type III']]
          pokedex[pokemon_name] = [t.lower() for t in types if t != '']
#+end_src

In the first line, we create an empty dictionary called ~pokedex~.
The symbol ~{}~ is the empty dictionary, and we it to the variable
named ~pokedex~. We could use any name here, and it is generally a good idea
to use names that make it easy to remember what variables are for.

The second line opens the file.
The ~open('pokedex.csv', 'r')~ tells python to open the file
named /pokedex.csv/, and that we are going to be /reading/ from it
(and not writing to it).
This gives us a /file handle/, that is an object that allows us to interact
with the file. In this case we named this object /dex/
(this is the ~as dex~ part of the line).
Again, we could have chose any other name.
Note that all subsequent lines begin with four spaces.
This is both intentional and necessary. The file will be closed automatically
once we write a line that does not being with four spaces.
A line beginning with four spaces is called /indented/ and lines
may be indented multiple times.

In the third line we create a so called /dictReader/, to read the csv
file properly.
The dict reader treats our csv as a collection of rows.
Each row is a dictionary where the keys are the names of the columns,
and the value is the text contained in that row and column.
Where do the names of the columns come from? The dictReader automatically
uses the first line of our csv file for the names.
We give this dict reader the name ~dex_reader~ for future use.

Now we want to process each row of our csv one by one.
This is done with the ~for x in y:~ construct.
If ~y~ is a collection of things, this allows us to do something
for each element ~x~ of this collection.
Here, we are going to do something for each ~row~ in the ~dex_reader~.
Again the name ~row~ is chosen by us, and we could have used any other name.

The next line gets the name of the Pokemon from each row, and stores it in
the variable ~pokemon_name~.
Here we see how we can use a dictionary:
The first column is named "Pokemon", and we can see this in the csv.
Then we write ~row['Pokemon']~.
This asks the dictionary ~row~: "What value do you have at the key 'Pokemon'?".
And we get the text contained in that field as a response.
We don't want to worry about spelling, so we make the name of the Pokemon
all lower case, useing the ~.lower()~ method.
To summarize, this asks the row for the text in the column named "Pokemon",
makes that text all lower case, and stores the result in the variable
named ~pokemon_name~.

Next, we get the Pokemon's types, by asking the the row for it's
values at the keys "Type I", "Type II" and "Type III".
We store these in a list by enclosing these three thigns in square brackets
~[ ]~.
We save the list of types in a variable named ~types~.

** The Assignment Operator

When we write ~x = ...~ in python, here is what happens:
First, python computes what is on the right side of the equals sign (~=~).
/Then/, it stores the value in ~x~.

With this in mind we can decipher the last line.
First, lets look at the right of the equal sign:
#+begin_src python
 [t.lower() for t in types if t != '']
#+end_src
This is called a /list comprehension/.[fn::
Learn more about [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists][lists]] and [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions][list comprehensions]]
]
Its value, once computed is a list.
What are the elements of the list?
For each element of the list ~types~,
if that element is not the empty string,
then that element is made to be all lower case,
and then added to the resulting list.
Let's dissect this more:
~for t in types~ tells us we will be looking at each element of the list
~types~. Next, ~if t != ''~ tells us to only look at an element
if it is not equal to the empty string. The notation ~t != ''~
can be read as "t is not equal to empty string".
Finally, the ~t.lower()~ part tells us that we will be adding the lower cased
version of the string to our resulting list.

Next let's look at the left side of the equals sign.
Since ~pokedex~ is a dictionary,
this is telling it, that the value corresponding to the key
~pokemon_name~ should be the list on the right side of the equals sign.

The next code block functions similarly:
#+begin_src python
  typechart = {}
  with open('typechart.csv', 'r') as t_chart:
      typechart_reader = csv.DictReader(t_chart)
      for row in typechart_reader:
          attacking_type = row['Attacking Type'].lower()
          multipliers = {}
          for t in row.keys():
              if t != 'Attacking Type':
                  multipliers[t.lower()] = float(row[t])
          typechart[attacking_type] = multipliers
#+end_src
The first five lines are analogous to the previous block
with different names.
The typechart is a table, and we want to access its elements
by specifying the name of a row and column.
For this, we will be storing dictionaries inside of a dictionary named
~typechart~.
The keys of ~typechart~ will be the names of the rows,
and the keys of the dictionaries inside of ~typechart~ will be
the names of the columns.
Why does this do the thing we want it to?
When we give ~typechart~ some key, it gives us the entire contents
of some row as a dictionary. Then, when we give the row the name of a column,
it can give us whatever it contains at that column.
This way we can reference cells by naming a row and column using only
dictionaries.

We create the dictionary ~multipliers~ and initially make it the empty
dictionary. In the last line,
we store it in the dictionary ~typechart~ under the key ~attacking_type~.
All we have left to do is to understand the three lines in between.

Recall from above, that the row in a dictReader is a dictionary,
whose keys are the names of the columns in our csv.
So, the line ~for t in row.keys():~ tells us we are doing something for
each key in the dictionary ~row~, i.e. for each column.

The next line is an /if statement/.
We check the condition, and the subsequent indeted code is only run
if the condition holds.
In this case, the condition we are checking for is that the name
of the column is not equal to "Attacking Type".
This is because this is the name of the first column, which contains the
names of our rows, and not the data we actuall care about. Hence, we want to
skip this column.

Finally, the last line saves some value to the dictionary multipliers
at the key ~t.lower()~ (i.e. the lowercased version of the column name).
What value is it? It is ~float(row[t])~. What does this mean?
First, ~row[t]~ is the text contained in the current row and column.
Python makes a distionction between the text consisiting of the three
characters zero "0", period "." and five "5", and the number ~0.5~.
To tell python that it should read this text as a number,
we have to enclose this value in ~float(...)~.
A ~float~ is a number that can have a decimal point.

** Functions

A /function/ is a bundled computation with a name.
The next two code block define two functions:
#+begin_src python
  def typechart_lookup(attacking, defending):
      return typechart[attacking][defending]

  def pokedex_lookup(attacking_type, defending_pokemon):
      result = 1
      types = pokedex[defending_pokemon]
      for t in types:
          result = result * typechart_lookup(attacking_type, t)
      return result
#+end_src
A function is defined by writing ~def~, then the name of the function,
here ~typechart_lookup~ and ~pokedex_lookup~, and finally a list of /parameters/
enclosed in parentheses.
Parameters are additional information we need to give a function in order to
use it. They are similar to a key for a dictionary, but a function can
perform complex computations instead of just looking up a value.
All the code belonging to a function must be indented.

The first function simply takes the names of an attacking type and
defending type and looks them up in our typechart.
The line ~return typechart[attacking][defending]~ tells us
that this function will give us back a value when we run it.
Specifically we will get whatever comes after the word ~return~.
A function's execution always ends when we encounter a ~return~,
so there can be no more code after the line containing ~return~.

The second function actually solves the problem we stated in the beginning:
We give it the name of an attacking type and the name of the defending pokemon
as parameters. And it computes for us how effective our attack is going to be.
In the first line we set ~result~ to ~1~, and in the last line
we return ~result~.
Let's look at what happens in between those lines:

First, we look to the pokedex, to get the defending pokemon's types,
and store the result (which is a list[fn::We
know this, because we made the ~pokedex~ a dictionary
which stores for each pokemon its list of types])
in a variable called types.
Then we go through each element of the list ~types~, using the ~for~-loop.

Finally, let's look at the line
#+begin_src python
  result = result * typechart_lookup(attacking_type, t)
#+end_src
Remember, we first evaluate the right side of the equality,
and then save the result to the variable on the left.
So, after this line executes, ~result~ is whatever it was before,
multiplied by the result of ~typchart_lookup(attacking_type, t)~.

To summarize we look up how the attacking type stack up against each of
the defeding Pokemon's types, and multiply the result by each of them
in turn. This is exactly what we described in the problem statement.

We can now test our program:
#+begin_src python
  print('fire attack vs chikorita:', pokedex_lookup('fire', 'chikorita'))
  print('grass attack vs lombre:', pokedex_lookup('grass', 'lombre'))
#+end_src
The ~print~ function tells python to show us the results as text.
Without it, python would just compute the numbers, and then not do
anything else with them.


* Entire Code
For convenience, here is the entire code in one place

#+begin_src python
  import csv

  pokedex = {}
  with open('pokedex.csv', 'r') as dex:
      dex_reader = csv.DictReader(dex)
      for row in dex_reader:
          pokemon_name = row['Pokemon'].strip().lower()
          types = [row['Type I'], row['Type II'], row['Type III']]
          pokedex[pokemon_name] = [t.lower() for t in types if t != '']

  typechart = {}
  with open('typechart.csv', 'r') as t_chart:
      typechart_reader = csv.DictReader(t_chart)
      for row in typechart_reader:
          attacking_type = row['Attacking Type'].lower()
          multipliers = {}
          for t in row.keys():
              if t != 'Attacking Type':
                  multipliers[t.lower()] = float(row[t])
          typechart[attacking_type] = multipliers

  def typechart_lookup(attacking_type, defending_type):
      return typechart[attacking_type][defending_type]

  def pokedex_lookup(attacking_type, defending_pokemon):
      result = 1
      types = pokedex[defending_pokemon]
      for t in types:
          result = result * typechart_lookup(attacking_type, t)
      return result

  print('fire attack vs chikorita:', pokedex_lookup('fire', 'chikorita'))
  print('grass attack vs lombre:', pokedex_lookup('grass', 'lombre'))
#+end_src
