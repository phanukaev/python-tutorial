This note is a step-by-step guide to getting a working set up
to start working with the Python programming language.
We will be using [[https://anaconda.com][Anaconda]] and [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/][PyCharm]].
Anaconda contains both the base python as well as the packages we will need
in this series. We are using it primarily because it is easy to set up.
PyCharm is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment][IDE]] for python.


* Windows

** Installing Anaconda
Head to [[https://anaconda.com/download][the anaconda download page]] and download the installer.
Run the downloaded program, there is no need to alter any of the settings.

** Installing PyCharm

Head to the [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/][PyCharm download page]] and scroll down to
/PyCharm Community Edition/.
Download and run the installer.

[[file:screengrabs/windows/pycharm_download_win.png]]

Click through the installer. In the /Installation Options/ screen,
check the two options shown below.
You may also choose the other options, but ensure that at least
the boxes shown below are checked:

[[file:screengrabs/windows/pycharm_install_opts.png]]


* MacOS

** Installing Anaconda

Head to [[https://anaconda.com/download#downloads][the anaconda download page]] and download the graphical installer.
Select the M1 version if your Macbook is newer than fall 2020 and
the non-M1 version otherwise.
Once the file is downloaded,
double click it and follow the instructions.


** Installing PyCharm

Head to the [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/][download page]] and scroll down until you see this:

#+attr_html: :width 700
file:screengrabs/image.png

If your Macbook is before fall of 2020, select intel, if it's newer, select apple silicon.
Once the download is finished, you can click on it here in your launcher

#+attr_html: :width 700
file:screengrabs/launcher.png

Drag the file as in the video:

#+begin_export html
<video controls width="700">
<source src="screengrabs/Screen_Recording_2024-02-17_at_11.08.47_AM.mov" />
#+end_export

* Other Operating Systems

If you use a different operating system, you are on your own.

* Checking that Everything Works

Open PyCharm and select /new project/.
In the interpreter type section, select /base conda/.
The field /path to conda/ should be filled automatically,
and there is no need to modify it:

#+attr_html: :width 700
file:screengrabs/pycharm_conda.png

Click /create/.
Right click in the left side of the window and create a new python file

#+attr_html: :width 700
file:screengrabs/new_file.png

Copy the below code into the new file and click the play button in the top
right.
#+begin_src python
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import csv

  l = csv.field_size_limit()
  print(l)

  data = {'a': np.arange(50),
          'c': np.random.randint(0, 50, 50),
          'd': np.random.randn(50)}
  data['b'] = data['a'] + 10 * np.random.randn(50)
  data['d'] = np.abs(data['d']) * 100

  plt.scatter('a', 'b', c='c', s='d', data=data)
  plt.xlabel('entry a')
  plt.ylabel('entry b')
  plt.show()

  an_array = np.array(range(11))
  total = np.sum(an_array)

  if total == 55:
      print('IT SEEMS THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL!')
      exit(0)

  print('SOMETHING HAS PROBABLY GONE WRONG!')
#+end_src

A window with a plot should pop up. Once you close it the last two
lines in the bottom panel should read
#+begin_src text
IT SEEMS THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL!

Process finished with exit code 0
#+end_src
In this case everything is probably set up correctly.
